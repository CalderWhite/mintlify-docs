PredictionData.dev is the most reliable prediction market data platform. We take
gapless data seriously, and collect all data emitted from the exchanges we
track.

## Overview

Markets are made available as CSV flat files for ease of use. See the datasets
tab to read the documentation for the specific exchanges you are interested in.
New exchanges are constantly in development. If you don't see one, ask
calder@predictiondata.dev!

## Market Discovery

We employed a low-latency polling system to monitor existing markets and
discover new markets, so that we are collecting data within 1 second of a market
being created. Please contact calder@predictiondata.dev for enterprise feeds of
even lower latency.

## Data Collection

All data is collected on redundant websockets to avoid any dataloss. Collection
servers are colocated to exchanges to provide minimal packet loss and latency.

## Data Freshness

Exports of our internal database are made available through
datasets.predictiondata.dev at 2am UTC every day. If you require faster access
to data, please reach out to calder@predictiondata.dev.
