PredictionData.dev is the **most reliable** prediction market data platform. We take
gapless data seriously, and collect all data emitted from the exchanges we
track.

There are **no rate limits** on how many requests per second you make or how
much data you download! Our infrastructure can support **terabytes** of outbound data per second.
If you are interested in bulk exports to make backfilling your database easier,
reach out to calder@predictiondata.dev for daily parquet snapshots of the database!

## Overview

Markets are made available as CSV flat files for ease of use. See the datasets
tab to read the documentation for the specific exchanges you are interested in.
New exchanges are constantly in development. If you don't see one, ask
calder@predictiondata.dev!

## Market Discovery

We employ a low-latency polling system to discover new markets. Markets are
being watched within 1 second of being created. Please contact
calder@predictiondata.dev for enterprise feeds with **\<100ms** latency.

## Data Collection

All data is collected on redundant websockets to avoid any dataloss. Collection
servers are colocated to exchanges to provide minimal packet loss and latency. For reference, p50 latency to Polymarket's matching engine is **\<10ms**.

## Data Freshness

Exports of our internal database are made available through
datasets.predictiondata.dev at 2am UTC every day. If you require faster access
to data, please reach out to calder@predictiondata.dev.
